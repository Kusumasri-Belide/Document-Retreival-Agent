PYTHON TOOLKIT : TICKET CLUSTERING ANALYSIS 
DESIGN DOCUMENT
1. Introduction & Objectives
This system automates the generation of detailed ticket summaries and categorizes tickets into meaningful clusters. It addresses the challenge of unstructured, inconsistent, and noisy ticket descriptions by providing:
Generated Summary (~200 words) derived exclusively from Short Description , Description, Additional Comments and Work Notes.
Ticket Cluster assignment into predefined categories or new clusters if required.
Structured outputs in Excel/CSV for downstream reporting and integration with ticketing tools.
Objective: Improve ticket triage, routing efficiency, and analytics by enabling automated summarization and clustering.
2. Data Understanding
The system works with ticket data containing columns such as:
Number – Ticket identifier
Account – Customer/tenant raising the ticket
Short Description – Concise one-line problem statement
Category – Initial user-provided category
Priority – Criticality/urgency
Description – Detailed issue explanation
Assigned To, Additional Comments, Work Notes, Resolution Notes – Contextual/auxiliary fields
Important: Only Short Description, Description, Additional Comments and Work Notes are used for generating summaries and clustering.
3. Preprocessing Logic
Data loading: Input CSV/Excel is read, ensuring correct schema.
Cleaning: Handles whitespace, newline normalization, special characters, and duplicates.
Filtering: Retains only Short Description and Description for NLP processing.
Missing handling: If Description is absent, fallback to Short Description only.
Metadata creation: Tracks ticket lengths, presence of fields, and preprocessing outcomes.
This ensures high-quality, normalized inputs before passing to NLP models.
4. NLP Approach
The system employs LLM-based summarization and vectorization:
Summarization:
Uses an LLM to combine Short Description and Description into a coherent, structured summary (~200 words).
Style is professional and concise, avoiding fabricated details.
Summaries maintain factual integrity and represent the original issue clearly.
Vectorization (in vectorize.py):
Converts text into embeddings (dense vector representations).
Enables semantic similarity comparisons and clustering.
Provides foundation for grouping related tickets.
5. Clustering Approach
Rule-based classification:
Predefined clusters like ServiceNow login issues, Performance issues, etc.
Keyword and phrase matching for high-confidence assignments.
Semantic clustering:
Embeddings from vectorize.py are clustered using algorithms like K-Means or HDBSCAN.
Similar tickets are grouped even if worded differently.
Cluster naming:
Extracts key terms or uses LLMs to propose meaningful cluster labels.
Matches new clusters against predefined categories; otherwise, proposes new categories.
6. Tech Stack
Language: Python
Data Handling: pandas, numpy
Summarization: LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace models)
Embeddings: sentence-transformers or managed embedding APIs
Clustering: scikit-learn (KMeans), HDBSCAN for semantic grouping
Configuration: YAML-based config management
Outputs: Excel/CSV via pandas I/O functions
8. Evaluation & Output
Evaluation
Summarization:
Human validation for fluency, factual correctness, and completeness.
Automatic checks for summary length and entity overlap with source.
Clustering:
Internal metrics: silhouette score, cluster cohesion.
Business metrics: accuracy of routing, reduction in manual reassignments.
Output
Final Excel/CSV contains all original columns plus:
Generated Summary
Ticket Cluster
Optional metadata like confidence score and assignment method
